What a book, what a book, what a book.

The relief text from the dust jacket says it all:

_"Every Practical Knot - What it looks like, who used it, where it comes from, and how to tie it"_

Even if you aren't all that interested in knots, If you ever get the chance to thumb through a copy you should.  An exceptional example of 'passion project' that has become an unequivocal reference in any arena where knots are used.  If you're in one of those arenas, you may even have seen it referenced  as _ABOK#1010_ (the classic Bowline) without knowing the meaning.  

There's some great story and background in the book and while it's largely divided by knot 'type' (generally descriptive but largely arbitrary categorizations) the real beauty is in the artfully illustrated renditions and a quirky iconic legend to convey some thematic reference.  A knot's illustrated 'algorithm' or tying instructions may include a skull and cross bones to indicate it is 'dangerous' (presumably in use, not in tying.)  Others create useful categorizations that sweep across the books main mechanism to identify a knot as "important" (a decorative crown icon) or "reliable" (an anchor icon).  There are nearly 2 dozen of these small iconic labels.  Some knots may have 1, some 2, most none, but in all cases they serve a pleasant and compelling visual descriptor of the knots without reading the specific details.
