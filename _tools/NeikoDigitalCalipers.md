I bought these for some very specific purpose that's now entirely lost to me.  I use them a couple times a month and they get the job done.  They're certainly accurate enough for all of my] purposes.  I've used them for rough metalwork/blacksmithing, plastic/acrylic fabrication, and all kinds of modeling for 3d printing tasks recently.
