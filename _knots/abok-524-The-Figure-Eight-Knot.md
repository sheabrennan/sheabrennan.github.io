text: "The Figure-Eight Knot has a single rim part, which passes completely around the neck, and it has another single part at the top which nips the end.  The Oysterman's Stopper (#526) has three parts around the rim and one part at the top, which nips the end.  That suggest a knot, between the two, with two rim parts, and with the end nipped by a single top part."

## Discussion

This is a simple and elegant knot.  Belonging to a category called 'stopper' or terminal knots it's utility in preventing the rope from 'unreeving' or pulling through something it shouldn't.  That could be numereous things, like a grommet in a tarp or the body of some other knot.  In the latter, it can be used to provide extra security in a knot and will frequently be found as a 'finish' to compound knots.

There is also utility in quickly adding mass to the end of a line, with a fast-to-tie, compact, and easy to untie knot.

Hinted at in the text of the knot is one of the most interesting parts of this book. Because so many knots are derivations of or companions to other knots, there are numerous seeming duplications throughout the book. This knot actually appears (at least) twice; initially as ABOK#520.  The presentations are tied uniquely; perhaps a mirror or left/right handed, or with some other unique method.  In the initial presentation, this knot is the 2nd in a progression of 5 knots, Beginning with The Overhand Knot ABOK#519.

Our choice, ABOK#524 initiates another series of 5 knots (Figure-Eight, Tweenie, Oysterman's Stopper, The Quatrefoil, and the Cingquefoil) all sharing a patterened 

## Typing

There's not a ton to this knot.

It dresses pretty easily.

This presentation is actually yet another method (not present in ABOK#520 )  I didn't immediately understand this one.  But after tying it rote a few times, and inspecting the dressed knot, it's actually just **upside-down**  Along with the presentation in #520, which is essentially the mirror of #524, you can tie this knot (at least) 4 ways.
