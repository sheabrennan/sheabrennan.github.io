I got a really great [book](/books/abok.html) a while ago and in an effort to help build some habits and develop some simple skills at the same time, I'm going to try learning a (very small) subset of the knots therein.  

I talk about it a bit on the book page, but essentially there are several iconically identified collections in the book: 

{% include image.html url="/assets/images/knotahabit/PXL_20230129_214014402.jpg" description="The icons in question" %}

I'm going to start with all the "Best For The Purpose" ones.  The list isn't necessary any kind of 'all-star' set and certainly isn't a "Top X Knots to Know" kind of list.  There's some overlap in use cases and there are some that are pretty unlikely to come up in everyday use (e.g the Jury Mast Knot)  but Clifford Ashley was obsessed with knots in a way that defies most common understanding.  It's hope that picking a list so authoritatively subjective that i'll capture some unwritten body of his meaning.

This list **also** avoids most of the extra tools and setup for some of the more complicated knots which makes it all that much more accessible.
